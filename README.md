# 🎶 Mood Music Player  

**Feel your vibe, play your tribe.**  
This is a small passion project I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — a music player that changes with your **mood**.  
No logins, no complex setup — just choose how you feel and vibe to the perfect playlist 💫

## 🌈 Features  
- 🎭 **Mood-based Music:** Pick your current mood — Happy, Chill, Sad, Energetic, Romantic, or Focused — and get instant playlists that match it.  
- 💫 **Dynamic Feel:** The background, colors, and animations shift with your mood to create a complete vibe.  
- 🔗 **Instant Playlist Access:** Connects directly to mood-specific playlists (non-Spotify, so it’s quick and simple).  
- 🎨 **Smooth & Clean Design:** Minimal interface, soft transitions, glowing elements, and floating visuals for an aesthetic experience.  
- 🧠 **No Frameworks Needed:** 100% pure frontend — just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
